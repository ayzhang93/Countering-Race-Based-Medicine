### Clinical Uses

**From UpToDate, ["Selecting reference values for pulmonary function tests"](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selecting-reference-values-for-pulmonary-function-tests?search=spirometry%20race&source=search_result&selectedTitle=2~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=2#H5):**

Race/ethnicity — Race/ethnicity can affect the normal values for pulmonary function tests (PFTs) although determination of race/ethnicity in an individual patient can be complicated; patients may be of mixed heritage and may not always know their exact racial/ethnic background.

Healthy African-Americans have spirometric values that are approximately 12 percent lower than Americans of Caucasian descent of the same age, sex, and height. This difference is, in part, due to a difference in the ratio of trunk size to standing height, ie, African-Americans have longer legs for a given height. Genetics and nutritional factors may also play a role in differences by race/ethnicity.

Predicted values for spirometric parameters (forced vital capacity [FVC] and forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1]) should ideally be obtained from studies of healthy persons of the same racial and ethnic background as the patient being tested. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations for spirometry were derived for Caucasian, African-American, and Mexican-American backgrounds. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) 2012 equations were derived for Caucasians, African-Americans, North Asians, and Southeast Asians.

Reference data are needed for non-Caucasians, particularly Arab, Indian, Polynesian, African, and Latin American peoples, including ethnic minorities. In the meantime, a composite equation is provided for those not represented in these groups or of mixed racial/ethnic origin.

Predicted values for static lung volumes (eg, total lung capacity [TLC], functional residual capacity [FRC], residual volume [RV]), DLCO, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP) may also be corrected for racial/ethnic differences (figure 3) [10]. However, the data are scant for these non-spirometric measures of pulmonary function.

### Background

**Dorothy Roberts, ["What's Race Got To Do With Medicine?" TEDMED Talk, NPR Transcript.](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/514150399)**:

"...many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery.

Dr. Samuel Cartwright practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War. And he was a well-known expert on what was then called negro medicine. He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently. Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons. He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them. He wrote in a medical journal it is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom.

To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs. Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim that black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people. Some even use a modern-day spirometer that actually has a button labeled race so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race. It's a well-known function called correcting for race."

### How is race determined for PFTs? 

**NIOSH Spirometry Training Guide 2003 Edition (most up-to-date):**

“To evaluate pulmonary function and to make recordings, the operator must enter the subject’s race. An attempt should be made to determine and record the employee’s race or ethnicity. Often this can be done with adequate accuracy merely by observation. If in doubt, ask the employee, explaining that race affects the reference values used for the test. 

If the employee considers the question objectionable, or if their race or ethnicity does not clearly fit the limited categories available, just record unknown and use Caucasian reference equations (no race correction or race-specific reference value)."
