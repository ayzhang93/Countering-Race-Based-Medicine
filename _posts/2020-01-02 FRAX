title: Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX)
---

## Clinical Uses

Guidelines explaining FRAX on databases like UpToDate routinely mention race/ethnicity, sometimes conflated with each other, including but not limited to:

UpToDate, ["Screening for Osteoporosis"](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-osteoporosis?search=osteoporosis%20race&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=1):
-Advanced age
-Previous fracture
-Long-term glucocorticoid therapy
-Low body weight (less than 58 kg [127 lb])
-Parental history of hip fracture
-Cigarette smoking
-Excess alcohol intake
*-Race/ethnicity (higher risk in white adults than in black, Hispanic, or Asian adults)*

Limitations — FRAX is a useful clinical tool for assessment of fracture risk. As with all clinical tools, however, there are some limitations. Limitations include lack of extensive validation in treated patients, limitation to four ethnicities (Caucasian, Black, Hispanic, Asian) in the United States, uncertainty regarding the range of error with fracture risk, and lack of validation with BMD measurements by technologies other than DXA.

## Background

The data for the U.S. model for FRAX comes from this study. The data was gathered from a single county in Minnesota from 1989 to 1991, where over 90% of resident identified as non-Hispanic whites:

Vertebral fractures are the classic hallmark of osteoporosis, yet little is known of their epidemiology. The incidence of clinically diagnosed vertebral fractures was therefore directly assessed in the predominantly white (European descent) population of Rochester, Minnesota. Altogether, 341 Rochester residents were radiologically diagnosed for the first time with one or more vertebral fractures in the 5 year study period, 1985-1989. The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate was 117 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 105 to 130). The age-adjusted rate in women (145 per 100,000 person-years) was almost twice that in men (73 per 100,000 person-years). Of all fractures, 47 (14%) followed severe trauma, 282 (83%) followed moderate or no trauma, and 12 (3%) were pathologic. Incidence rates for fractures following moderate trauma were higher in women than in men and rose steeply with age in both genders. In contrast, fractures following severe trauma were more frequent in men, and their incidence increased less with age. These Rochester rates are greater than those previously reported from studies in Britain and Sweden but lower than the incidence rates extrapolated from a prevalence study in this population.

A previous 1998 study had reported incidence of vertebral fractures in Hispanic patients. Significant exceprts are below.

From the methods section:
“In this study, we identified a national cohort of Hispanics by **Spanish surname**, selecting all persons resident in the US proper with surnames on the list developed by Passel and Word at the US Bureau of Census, **regardless of race/ethnicity code**. Then, to separate th  Hispanic population by ancestry, we used the 1990 Census Public Use Microdata Sample to identify states where the Hispanic elderly population is overwhelmingly of one ancestry. These states are Texas (for Mexican Americans), Arizona (for Mexican Americans), and Florida (for Cubans). However, there is no state where a majority of elderly Hispanics self-identify as Puerto Rican. Therefore, Puerto Ricans were identified as persons living in Puerto Rico (which participates in Medicare) or the 50 states whose Social Security number indicates issuance in Puerto Rico.

From the limitations section:
"The method of ethnic identification is a concern in this study. However, all methods of detennining Hispanic ethnicity are imperfect. Birthplace, even if it were available, has low sensitivity for Mexican Americans, most of whom are US born. Regardless of whether birthplace, self-identification, or surname is used, findings may not be generalizable to populations identified by another method."

## Clinical Implications

"Significantly fewer African-American than white women were referred for a DXA scan (OR 0.39%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22 to 0.68). Physicians were also less likely to mention consideration of osteoporosis in medical records (0.27, 0.15 to 0.48) and to recommend calcium and vitamin D supplementation for this population (0.21, 0.11 to 0.37). If referred, African-American women had comparable DXA completion rates when compared with white women. No physician characteristics were significantly associated with DXA referral patterns."
